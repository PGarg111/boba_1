        <p>Orcas, also known as killer whales, are <span class="highlight">highly intelligent</span> and <span
                style="animation-delay: 1s;" class="highlight">social marine mammals</span>. They are known for their
            striking black and white coloration and are found in oceans all over the world. Commonly, they are <span
                style="animation-delay: 2s;" class=highlight>found in colder waters</span>, for example the Arctic and
            Antarctic regions. Because of their position in the ocean food web, they earned themselves the nickname
            <span style="animation-delay: 3s;" class=highlight>"Wolves of the Sea"</span>. The nickname <span
                style="animation-delay: 4s;" class=highlight>"Killer Whale"</span>derives from their hunting skills and
            another symbol of their role as <span style="animation-delay: 5s;" class=highlight>apex predators</span>.
            Naturally, Orcas have no natural predators (as seen in their position in the ocean food web). Orcas are
            <span style="animation-delay: 6s;" class=highlight>part of the dolphin family</span> and therefore have
            similar behaviors and traits. Orcas usually travel in pods with their family and are <span
                style="animation-delay: 7s;" class=highlight>highly intelligent</span>.

        Behavior</h3>
    <div class="about">
        <p>Orcas are known for their complex social structures and behaviors. They <span class=highlight
                style="animation-delay: 8s">live in family groups called pods</span>, which can consist of up to 40
            individuals. These pods are often <span class=highlight style="animation-delay: 9s">matriarchal,</span> with
            the oldest female leading the group. Orcas communicate with each other using a variety of vocalizations,
            including clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls. They are also known to use <span class=highlight
                style="animation-delay: 10s">echolocation</span> to hunt for prey, demonstrating their advanced
            cognitive abilities.</p>
