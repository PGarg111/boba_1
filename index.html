        <p>Orcas, also known as killer whales, are <span class="highlight">highly intelligent</span> and <span
                style="animation-delay: 1s;" class="highlight">social marine mammals</span>. They are known for their
            striking black and white coloration and are found in oceans all over the world. Commonly, they are <span
                style="animation-delay: 2s;" class=highlight>found in colder waters</span>, for example the Arctic and
            Antarctic regions. Because of their position in the ocean food web, they earned themselves the nickname
            <span style="animation-delay: 3s;" class=highlight>"Wolves of the Sea"</span>. The nickname <span
                style="animation-delay: 4s;" class=highlight>"Killer Whale"</span>derives from their hunting skills and
            another symbol of their role as <span style="animation-delay: 5s;" class=highlight>apex predators</span>.
            Naturally, Orcas have no natural predators (as seen in their position in the ocean food web). Orcas are
            <span style="animation-delay: 6s;" class=highlight>part of the dolphin family</span> and therefore have
            similar behaviors and traits. Orcas usually travel in pods with their family and are <span
                style="animation-delay: 7s;" class=highlight>highly intelligent</span>.
        </p>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 50px; font-size: 80px;" class="header-animation">Their Intelligence and Behavior</h3>
    <div class="about">
        <p>Orcas are known for their complex social structures and behaviors. They <span class=highlight
                style="animation-delay: 8s">live in family groups called pods</span>, which can consist of up to 40
            individuals. These pods are often <span class=highlight style="animation-delay: 9s">matriarchal,</span> with
            the oldest female leading the group. Orcas communicate with each other using a variety of vocalizations,
            including clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls. They are also known to use <span class=highlight
                style="animation-delay: 10s">echolocation</span> to hunt for prey, demonstrating their advanced
            cognitive abilities.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 50px;" class="header-animation">Orcas vs. Sharks</h3>
    <div class="about">
        <p>Orcas and sharks are both apex predators in the ocean, but they have <span class=highlight
                style="animation-delay: 11s">different hunting strategies</span> and
            behaviors. Orcas are known for their intelligence and social structures, often <span class=highlight
                style="animation-delay: 12s">hunting in groups</span> to take
            down larger prey. Sharks, on the other hand, are solitary hunters that <span class=highlight
                style="animation-delay: 13s;">rely on their speed and stealth</span> to
            catch smaller fish. While both animals are powerful predators, their approaches to hunting and their roles
            in the marine ecosystem are quite distinct. When offspring are born, shark offspring have to get as far away
            from the mother as possible (the mother is ferocious making it dangerous to stay close). In contrast, baby
            orcas (calf) are nursed by their mothers, much like our own.</p>
