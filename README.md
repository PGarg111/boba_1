First project for Boba Olympics

This project is all about Orcas!!
It features an about section, their intelligence, Orcas vs. Sharks, and some fun facts.
All the sections have headers with color gradients and hover animations. Additionally, there is a highlight animation to make the important information pop. 
The Orcas vs. Sharks section features a comparison table between the two species as well as a video with more information. 
The fun facts have a few facts about Orcas in an unordered list. 
The background is a color gradient and has bubble animations to show the natural habitat of Orcas.
